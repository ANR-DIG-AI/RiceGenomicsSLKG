The Rice Genomics Scientific Literature KG is a FAIR knowledge graph that exploits the Semantic Web technology and FAIR principles, to integrate information about Named Entities (NE) extracted automatically from a corpus of PubMed scientific papers on rice genomics.

# Semantic Data Model
The core part of the KG data model is based on the [W3C Web Annotation Ontology (OA)](https://www.w3.org/ns/oa) which has been complemented by nine different vocabularies to describe documents metadata, provenance information.
